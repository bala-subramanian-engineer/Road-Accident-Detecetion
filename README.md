# Road Accident Detection using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting road accidents from images, designed for integration with traffic monitoring systems.

## Features

- Binary classification (accident vs. no accident)
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model with multiple convolutional layers
- REST API for real-time detection
- Batch processing capabilities
- Integration-ready alert system
